Decision Tree Model Implementation & Visualization
Project Overview
In this task, you will build and visualize a Decision Tree Model using Scikit-Learn to classify or predict outcomes based on a chosen dataset. This hands-on project will help you understand how decision trees work and how they can be used for predictive analysis.

steps:
Select a Dataset – Choose a dataset suitable for classification or prediction.
Preprocess the Data – Clean, transform, and prepare the data for training.
Build the Decision Tree Model – Use Scikit-Learn to create and train the model.
Visualize the Decision Tree – Generate a clear visualization of the tree structure.
Analyze the Results – Interpret the model’s performance and accuracy.
