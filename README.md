# DECISION-TREE-IMPLEMENTATION
Decision Tree with Scikit-Learn   We load a dataset, preprocess it, and split it into training &amp; testing sets. A DecisionTreeClassifier is trained to classify outcomes. Using plot_tree(), we visualize decision splits. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy &amp; confusion matrix. Fine-tuning prevents overfitting
